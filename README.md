# LoadBalancing
 Implements various algorithms for load balancing and client association. It includes a CVX solver and a centralized algorithm for solving the convex program of load balancing using the dual sub-gradient method. The feasible region is the convex hull of all possible b-matchings between clients and access points. The convex program maximizes an objective function set to be a concave utility function of the client throughputs. Further implementation of a distributed client-centric algorithm is provided where each client selfishly decides to associate with an access point based on the load and expected utility. The network layouts are chosen according to the scenarios specified in LTE standards (3GPP TR 36.893 http://www.qtc.jp/3GPP/Specs/36839-b00.pdf). Detailed results on algorithm performance are provided in the paper:  https://arxiv.org/pdf/1407.6731.pdf
